CHAPTER 1 - INTRO TO DJANGO
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Django was started in 2003 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison at the 'Journal-World' newspaper
    in Lawrence, KS.  In 2005, they released the first public version of the framework.



- Design Principles

    1. DRY
    2. Explicit is Better Than Implicit
    3. Loosely Coupled Architecture
    


- Rails vs Django

    Rails has a lot of implicit behavior.  For instance, this example shows request parameters automatically
      being implicitly available to the controller, instance variables automatically being passed from
      controller to the view, and the correct view automatically being inferred from the method name.

      class StoresController < ApplicationController
        def show
          # Automatic access to request parameters
          @store = Store.find(params[:id])
          # Instance variable automatically available in view
          # Automatically uses the 'show' template
        end
      end


    By contast, each of these things must be explicitly declared in Django.

      def detail(request, store_id):
          store = Store.objects.get(id=store_id)
          # Instance variables must be passed explicitly
          # Explicit template must be assigned
          return render(request, 'store/detail.html', {'store': store})
