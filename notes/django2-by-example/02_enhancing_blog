CHAPTER 2 - ENHANCING THE BLOG APPLICATION

- Sharing Posts By Email

    - First, we allow users to share posts by sending them as emails.  We need to:

        1. Create a form for users to enter their name and email, the email recipient, and 
             optional comments

        2. Create a view in the 'views.py' file that handles the posted data and sends the
             email

        3. Add a URL pattern for the new view in the 'urls.py' file

        4. Create a template to display the form



- Creating Forms with Django

    - We'll start by building the form to share posts.  We'll use Django's built-in forms
        framework.

      Django comes with 2 base classes to build forms:

        1. 'Form' = allows you to build standard forms
        2. 'ModelForm' = allows you to build forms tie to model instances

    
    - First, we create the form.  Forms can reside anywhere in a project, but the convention is to
        put them in a 'forms.py' inside each application.

        # blog/forms.py
        from django import forms

        class EmailPostForm(forms.Form):
            name = forms.CharField(max_length=25)
            email = forms.EmailField()
            to = forms.EmailField()
            comments = forms.CharField(required=False, widget=forms.Textarea)
