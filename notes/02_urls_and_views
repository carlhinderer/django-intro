CHAPTER 2 - DJANGO URLS AND VIEWS
-----------------------------------------------------------

- URL Regular Expressions

    - The precedence rule is that granular urls come first, and broad urls come last.  If more than one
        URL matches the incoming request, the top one will get triggered.

        urlpatterns = [
            url(r'^about/',TemplateView.as_view(template_name='about.html')),
            url(r'^about/index/',TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html')),
        ]


    - Using exact patterns (which end with $) instead of wildcard matching, can make the URLs easier to
        reason about in a large application.

        urlpatterns = [
            url(r'^about/$',TemplateView.as_view(template_name='about.html')),
            url(r'^about/index/$',TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html')),
        ]


    - Exact patterns can end up causing extra work if you're doing SEO or A/B testing, since you'll need
        to provide an exact match for each URL you use.

        # SEO Example
        /about/the+coffeehouse+in+san+diego

        # A/B Testing Example
        /about/landing/a
        /about/landing/b



- Regex Syntax For URLs

    - Symbols

        ^     Start of URL
        +     1 or more occurrences
        []    Character grouping
        \D+   1 or more digits


    - Examples

        r'^$'                 Empty String
        r'^stores/'           /stores/ with anything after it
        r'^about/contact$'    /about/contact exactly
        r'^stores/\d+/'       /stores/ with any digit

        r'^drinks/mocha|espresso/'    /drinks/mocha or /drinks/espresso with anything after it


    - Note that Django URLs do not inspect GET request query strings.
